## Minutes

**Notion (Public)**
CG: I’d like us to use Notion next week
(no one objects)

**Deprecate implicit injections (public)**
RJ: I wanted to write this as a blog post but I ran out of time, so I am going to write it as an RFC. Please review the pre-RFC.
(discussion about it)

**Action Items:** Rob is going to look into more specifics on making this idea happens since no one objects.

**Default Data Store (public)**
RJ: this.store.find is not great- how could we do this?
MB: wycats would want to talk about this, he remains in favor of default data-loading magic
