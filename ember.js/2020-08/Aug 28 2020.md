## Action Items

- [ ]  Reply on [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/648](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/648) that we do not believe we can make this change in a stable version of Ember due to the unreliability of the underlying implementation and uncertainty about the impact. However, broccoli-asset-rev is itself already independent of Ember, and so this change could land into that project to be included in a major version breaking change release.
