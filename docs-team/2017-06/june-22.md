### Notes

#### Michael Schinis:

Fixed the tests except one (need help)  moving from one class route to another.  Not scrolling to the top.

TJ: I can look at it this week

MS: siva merged his stuff with mine, so its ready to merge once the test is fixed.

TJ: is search ready once this is merged?

MS: We will need to get Algolia to update their script.  I can contact them once merged.  Theyâ€™ve been helpful.

SK: DB wrote an issue for supporting the old urls is that ready?

TJ: I think it should work though there may be an issue around namespaces.  Will verify that it is good to go.

MS: will have some bandwidth after api-docs app stuff gets finished.  Willing to pick up things from the guides issue list.  Need to know what is high priority.

TJ: will make a pass and consult the team.  See if we can tag them

MS: Feel free to assign stuff to me if you like.

#### Sivakumar:

SK: Working with Dave Wasmer to get Help Wanted deployed.

SK:Right now we are overriding the hostname in fastboot, which is hacky.  Will be cleaner using middleware.  Should solve some of the odd redirection stuff we are seeing.

SK: Also we are using fastly addon for heroku.  will remove and use a fastly service.  For every instance of heroku app we deploy we have to add a fastly addon which is $50 each.  if we use the service instead we can take advantage of our allowance with

SK: Also now with every glimmer styleguide branch we deploy to fastly.  will eventually want to move more pieces of the website over.  See https://glimmer-styleguide.global.ssl.fastly.net/glimmer-styleguide/master/index.html
