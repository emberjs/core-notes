### Notes

#### How do we want to make use of the "stale PRs" tracking doc?

Mostly just looking at our number across time so we notice if it's getting out of hand, or if we are doing particularly well.

#### RFC Tracking

Most of today's meeting was spent looking through [RFC tracking](https://github.com/emberjs/rfc-tracking), workshop-style.
The purpose of that repo is to help us track implementation of merged RFCs, so we aren't blindsided by changes that need to be made on the learning side.
The core teams are all responsible for updating these issues. 
Community members are invited to participate too! Just add your thoughts as a comment on the issue, and ping a core team person so that they copy & paste your work into the main issue comment.

Moving forward, we will figure out a way together with the other teams to show which RFC tracking issues still need review from various teams.

To catch up on the backlog, we'll ask for volunteers who can help review them, then divide them up.

##### Ember Data monorepo docs

* 3.9 beta does not have the monorepo structure
* 3.9 which I am working on publishing will also not have the monorepo structure
* 3.10 beta will have the monorepo structure
* 3.10 will only have the monorepo structure if we've addressed this by release time, else we'd likely re-release 3.9 to buy us more time
* please update the RFC tracking with what we need to do, especially if there are items we need to help you with
