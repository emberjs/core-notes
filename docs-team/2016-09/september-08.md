GJ: will share updates when I have them

### Nested Routes

TJ: Nest routes tutorial has not had core eyes, but it has had several folks look at it. 

LS: Is it something we think we can merge?

TJ: Yes.   We think its ready, and I know the core team is busy with glimmer

LS: will mention it at the next core meeting that it has been merged and they can look, provide feedback for updates if they want. (later: got ebryn to comment)

### Addons in Guides

DB: Alex Speller suggested mentioning a specific addon in the guides, which raises a broader question of should we mention commonly used addons in the guides?  

GJ: Addons are hugely important and it might be good to identify the top ones.

DB: I think that mirage and simple-auth would be top 2.  The downside of mentioning is keeping up with maintenance of addons.  We might add to the main learn page. 

TJ: How would be decide?  Something we as team decide?  Would probably have to have good docs.

GJ: We could start small and see from there.  If docs lacking we could help beef up before linking.
