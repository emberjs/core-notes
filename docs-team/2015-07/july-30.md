These minutes are worse than @locks's. Sorry. God willing he will be back next week.

* stefanpenner said he has had several companies make the same ember data mistakes and wants to help with the guides
* wecc and tomdale are very excited to help with models/ember data too
* michaelrkn said to loop in with locks on that
* https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/408 - michael will close this and open specific issues
* mixonic will take on updating the guides with closure actions
* how to get content back ported into 1.13 - moratorium or cherry-picking?
* michaelrkn says cherry-picking, says that locks says moratorium
* 2.0 and 1.13 will be mostly be the same
* trek points out actually they will diverge
* after some discussion, cherry-picking is chosen
