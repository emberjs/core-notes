### Notes

#### API Docs

TJ: working on the API Docs and got a version for review ready on https://ember-api-docs-staging-pr-353.herokuapp.com/api/ember/2.16/modules/@ember%2Fapplication

DB: might be good to drop most of the old modules stuff (e.g. `ember-glimmer`) as it’s clearer

TJ: that’s what I was thinking, too

JW: does anyone work on a first pass on showing how to use the new modules syntax

RM: could simply show an example of how to import it

JW: some descriptive text might be useful as well


#### Guides

JW: working on guides urls should work before 2.16 release

#### Ember PR

JW: I have the feeling that most developers outside of the Ember community are not aware of its existence, it might be good to give good introduction talks / workshops at general JS events

RM: agree, if someone would like to talk about anything new or interesting in Ember, I’d also be able to help with e.g. podcasts
