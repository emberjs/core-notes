### Concretize making PRs for 2 Ember Guides issues (IL, 15-20 min)

IL - I think these feature requests will help in welcoming new visitors to the site. They do involve changing multiple files, possibly across multiple versions, so I'd like us to discuss how to divide the work involved so that each PR can be of reasonable size for review.

- [Replace "First" and "Last" name code examples](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1480)
- [Fix API links in the Guides that go to "release"](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1440)

Re: Issue 1480: 
- agree to use Professor Tomster and Doctor Zoey
- request to update at least the most current version of the API and guides. Additional updates at the discretion of the PR author.

Re: Issue 1440: 
- Need to determine metrics specifically around SEO goals to make more data-driven decisions
- ideally a solution will be good for current Ember developers and also search results
- Chris will update the issue with more information
