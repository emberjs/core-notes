## Topics

### Release week! (AG)

Next week is release week but also EmberFest week!

JW or JG probably need to run this release.

JW: will ask in core teams about who is releasing different packages, will they
be away for EmberFest? I can help prep our stuff in the meantime

JG: Will also be around to help with the release! Expects release helpers will
be around as usual or will be prepared ahead of time (runspired and Kelly)

### The Times (AG)

JG already created the next edition PR. AG added topics from news and
announcements. Lots of package releases to cover! Especially glint and v2
addons are highlights. AG will try to get some writing in. Will reach out
to Isaac and Aaron about their codemod efforts.

Volunteer writers welcome! https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1299

There is already 1 guest PR for ember-shiki

### Polaris edition (RM)

RM made a PR for the Polaris edition! 
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/1058

Launch ASAP in order to help people learn about it. Very minimal content,
and over the next weeks, we figure out what needs to be documented and 
add to it.

Blocker to shipping is that we need an image to replace Octane.

AG: should we use a placeholder?

RM: We could use the blueprint Tomster

RM will ship once we have an image in place.

### Ember API docs progress (JW)

https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/68

AG: If anyone is visiting EmberFest, we will take some time to discuss the
tabs! Lukas has been working on the new designs for API docs.

### TS support for the cheatsheet (JW)

We are now using ember-shiki for the octane cheatsheet, unlocking showing
TS examples https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/pull/112

Next steps to actually show TS examples:
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/issues/113

Amazing work by Ignace, thank you!

AG: can we use the ember-styleguide?

JW: yes, not in place because of historical timing when the site was made

Lukas: Can we use ember-shiki's tab system?

AG: great to show both a global toggle and the tabs

AG: visual inspiration for reference: 
https://embroider-build.github.io/scenario-tester/classes/Scenario.html

JW: we could start with tabs only for the cheatsheet while we work on the
toggle.

RM: also for the guides in the future, we need a global setting because
prose may need to change as well when someone is viewing TS examples


### Package scripts RFC

Moving along to open PRs for content! Don't merge them until the RFC is accepted.

RM: Would be ok with us merging PRs because it's not a breaking change

JW: yeah they will mostly be minor things.

The RFC is in FCP https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/831

JW will add approving review and ask for this to be moved to the next step.

RM: we need to fix linting checks

JW: will work with Mehul to get them fixed

RM: will commment too
