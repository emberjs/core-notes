### EmberData | deprecate legacy finder support RFC and how to implement in Guides (JG 15 min)

- EmberData is introducing an RFC to deprecate legacy finder support: [RFC 964](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/964)
- There is a desire to get this new approach documented in the Guides or somewhere sooner rather than later
- The RFC itself includes examples that could serve as a Guides/Cheatsheet examples
- Need to be sure the tutorial is not broken by this so it'd need to be updated too
- How long do we want Guides/Tutorial to show the new way before deprecating?
  - This is a deprecation that will go into 6 so the sooner we make docs avail the better since this is a big change
  - And the longer we give people to adjust the better
