### Ember Data Guides Rewrite (JW, 15)

I would like to get feedback on the outcomes of the brainstorming session with Scott Newcomer and Chris Ng. New ideas and questions welcome!

Summary - we reviewed the outline together and added some pieces that were missing. We also discussed where to put these guides and agreed to start with keeping them in the same place while revising content. Next steps are coordinating with the Ember Data team to get their feedback and ideas. If they are on board, later on, an RFC would follow.
