## Topics

### Do we still need `@ember/octanify`? (CM, 5mins)

In the guides for upgrading to Octane we tell people to use `@ember/octanify` https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/#toc_implementing but is this needed if your app is already on ember@3.16? It's hard to know exactly what octanify does because the readme is a bit sparse.

- yes we still use it. it sets the right package versions and sets the edition flag etc.
- the index.js is quite short so it should be good enough to just read it
- *chris reads the index.js*
- CM: we have a problem. If people are on later Ember versions it will actually **downgrade** some packages !! 
- Action item: update README. ([turns out there was an issue already](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-octanify/issues/8), re-posted in dev-ember-learning discord channel)
- [Created an issue to make the tool not downgrade things if they are later than the "octane" versions.](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-octanify/issues/10)
- we checked and it does show up in help-wanted üéâ

### Anything to be ready for Ember@4 (JW, 5m)

Ember 4 is coming, what do we need to do to get ready? 

- [There is an epic that is tracking things already](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19545)
- [There is also an issue full of missing depreaction guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/issues/893)
- we need volunteers to write deprecation guides
- don't merge https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/pull/899 yet because we might not have deprecations in v4 
- we can continue talking about this next week üëç
