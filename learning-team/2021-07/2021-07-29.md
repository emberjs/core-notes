## Topics

### RFC for welcome addon experience

Devashish is working on an RFC

Experience was that Devashish missed one line for adding CSS during the tutorial. They had to go through the whole guide for a download link

Options for moving forward:
- Provide CSS as part of guides instructions
- Add a flag for generating new app, ember new --super-rentals which includes the CSS files

We added this to the project board.

### Anything to be ready for Ember@4 (JW, 15m)

(continued from last week) Ember 4 is coming, what do we need to do to get ready? 

[Main tracking issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19545)

There is one new deprecation since we last reviewed this to-do list, and it already has a PR. We're in a pretty good spot!
