## Topics

### 1Password Teams for Open Source

RM: there was a sentence in the README about paid contributors which is confusing, so I reached out and am waiting for a reply.

### ember-api-docs

RM: "keep PR branch up-to-date" protection is really annoying for contributors.
RM: I'll bring it up next week when we have quorum.
