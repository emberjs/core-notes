### The end of lockstep

Prioritize https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/69/views/1 and start opening issues

JW - I posted about this core-meta to ask if anyone else has things to add.
I don't see any additions.

Let's chat again in 1 week.

### Triage cli-guides (RM, 20mins)
Issues: https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-asc

### Ember install

Should `ember install` be replaced with `npm install`? Should that be included in the
existing RFC by Dhanush and Mehul?

JW - to summarize the discussion, `ember install` can do a lot more than `npm install`
and so we should not include it in the open RFC. The scope of that RFC should
still be just `npm test` and `npm start`.

JG - yes it sounds like `ember install` is something that needs to be supported

We commented on https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/453 to clarify that the
RFC is only for test and start.

### Release blog post status

We made https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1193

JW - how do we encourage more core members to help with writing? The learning
team ultimately publishes it, but having everyone pitch in is the ideal.

JG - the data team was chatting about getting some help with release notes.

JW - what if we add something to the PR template asking for descriptions?
