## Topics

### PR tracking spreadsheet

JW: I tried to see if I could fix the PR review spreadsheet quickly and I could not.
We need to add it to help wanted
RM: This could be a hacktoberfest effort. I'm out next week but could help guide
volunteers.

### Tutorial component with yield keyword confusion (5min)
Issue: https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1739

Create these tickets:
- Remove the yield heading, and make some minor adjustments so the transition
between paragraphs still makes sense
- Revise the explanation of what yield does. Say it's common to create
wrapper components. Maybe mention Block content/Block components.
We already link to this.

RC: We used to refer to wrappers as layout components, but this was confusing.
We had a "wrapping content in a component" section.

### Netlify build image upgrade (RM, 15min)

RC: Netlify deprecated the build image for Ubuntu 14. The latest image is 
Ubuntu v20. We tried to updated but a bunch of them failed.
They failed, because when you create the netlify site, it pins
the versions of different binaries.
The Ruby version that was pinned wasn't supported in the new image.

RC: I found a workaround, which is that you pick a new build image
and relink the the netlify site to the same repo.

I meant to do a document where we could track the work done but didn't enough time. I thought we could take 15min and give it a go?

There are 5-6 sites remaining that are failing the build.
The sites are up but you can't build.

https://app.netlify.com/sites/guidemaker-default-template/deploys
https://app.netlify.com/sites/the-shortest-ember-book/deploys
https://app.netlify.com/sites/ember-statusboard/overview
https://app.netlify.com/sites/ember-tutorials/overview
https://app.netlify.com/sites/deprecated-ember-tutorials/overview
https://app.netlify.com/sites/ember-octane-vs-classic/deploys
Maybe https://app.netlify.com/sites/empress-documentation/overview

Some projects are failing bc the new build is using Node 16 and our
projects are ancient/incompatible with Node 16.
We could do an update of the projects or configure the node versions.

- [ ] Migrate Netlify sites to new build image
- [ ] Move environment variables to netlify config where it makes sense
- [ ] Have a meeting where we go through stale projects that we could remove.

We need to be careful of SEO - include CM in this meeting

RM - will try to update the shortest ember book content
JW - I will update the octane vs classic
JG - I have some time to look into Netlify too

### Hacktoberfest!

We have a new project board! https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/54

Use it to track Hacktoberfest issues and issues we still need to make.

JW - I am making more issues ASAP for the ember-api-docs
We should do something for the Ember Times.

We checked through a bunch of repos and they already have the 
hacktoberfest repo.

RC - we could add some automation for labeling PRs with hacktoberfest

RC - there's a good chance that the beta for CLI will come out this week.
We still have to close the loop on deprecations.

JW - Melanie is going to chat with Katie about next steps.

Action item:
- JW - Remind the rest of the teams that hacktoberfest is starting and
most of our repos already have the label.
