## Topics

After some housekeeping, Jared and Amy discussed Ember Times.

### Netlify build (RM, 20min)
I tried updating some of our Netlify projects to the latest Ubuntu image and things started breaking.
On top of that, I believe there are a couple of projects that could be taken down.
Let's do a quick review together and decide on a course of action.

- RM & JG investigated the cause of Netlify build failures on the latest build image and found a solution that forces an update of some build image dependencies that were outdated
