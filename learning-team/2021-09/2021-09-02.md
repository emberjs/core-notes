- Nudge some framework core people to look at https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1715
This may need to wait until after v4

- https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/1024
this is related to the Ember String htmlsafe deprecation. Chris made some updates but another addon may be doing something incorrect.

Why is this a hard failure in Fastboot, if this is just a deprecation? Something might be wrong here within ember.js. It still works (but is deprecated) in non-fastboot environments. Chris opened an issue: https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/issues/855 We have to wait on framework core to help with this.
If some more people have release permissions for fastboot, that will unlock progress.

JW: We can mention this to MS who is working on finding bottlenecks
CM: She is already in the loop

## Topics

### Ember data content problem

From a previous week's discussion - this is now fixed and released!

### Missing deprecations

https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/issues/893

- JW - I can write a sparse deprecation guide, extreme first draft, if we have agreement on merging something like that.
Then we can get help writing the real content. 
- CM - we can even start with placeholders. The URLs need to get into Ember Source before the release.
- JG - can we start on this now?
- JW - sure, after this meeting
- JW - does anyone know our timelines for Ember 4?
- CM - Sept 20th (same as in the release blog post)

### Ember 4 prep

The most important is fixing deprecation guides: https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/issues/893

Then doing API docs: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19702

Please ask everyone to help with this!

### v3.28

JW was planning to run the release. Waited to run it until the blog post was almost ready.

JW - has anyone run this besides locks?
CM - yes but there was an issue
JG - do we have a way to revert if there are problems?
JW - yes, you can copy the backup folder in S3 and then rename the copy

### Problems contributing to the Ember Website

See guides-source #1711

This looks like a windows symlinks problem. CM suggests using WSL2
instead of powershell. See https://cli.emberjs.com/release/appendix/windows/#wsl2
for guidance.

We opened a PR to improve the docs: https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides/pull/235

### For next week - Strategy for usage of deprecated APIs in content (RM, 15m)

https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/19729 was brought to our attention recently.
Because route/controller transition methods have been deprecated, the API documentation is not visible by default and the links seem to go nowhere.
Although it was clearly a lapse that the documentation was not updated accordingly, some questions came to mind:
- Do we want to reevaluate not showing deprecated code by default?
- Do we want to adjust how the approach prose changes for staged RFCs? Should we link to API documentation with the deprecated query param enabled?
