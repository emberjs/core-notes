## Topics

### What should these "since" versions be in the deprecation guides? (JW 10 mins)

See https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app/pull/954

For next week - the deprecation template says that the deprecation guide is required,
but we should review it together to make it as clear as possible.

Conclusion:
We fixed some release versions and will merge with a CTA to help write entries.
We will also follow up with RFC authors/contributors to ask for help.

### tool-new-release improvements (RM, 10min)

Status updates on this project, for context sharing:

RM: I'm actively working on https://github.com/ember-learn/tool-new-release and want
to give some updates.

RM: suggestions welcome for a rename of this tool. I have been working on it
for a little bit and have been using it for releases.
With some debugging, we can see that the problem comes from the scripts.
The tool clones the repos and runs the scripts that are in each repo.
I'm going to work on it a bit more - I have some ideas that would be useful.
The end goal is for anyone to use the tool, and even make it part of
an automated process. I also want it to have good messages/diagnostics.

RM: I am going to start putting deployment logic in the tool, in Rust.
The reason is that I don't like writing bash, any time you have to do something
complex. bash also does not run on windows. node is difficult too.
Rust has a good JS interpreter we can use.

RM: There were some concerns about people not knowing Rust.
You don't have to deal with types to understand this tool.
One change I'm not sure about is the API docs, since there's
a project by JW to use GitHub as a back end.
If you try to run the API docs compiler in heroku, it runs out of memory.

JW: The new API docs generation will build one version at a time, but
this tool shouldn't use the new scripts yet. They are still in flux.

RM: The scripts will still be in the repos, so hopefully the codebase
itself will be simple enough for anyone to pick up even though it's in Rust.

JW: Is there anything you need help with?

RM: Not at the moment. I am also going to bundle the tool as a zip to
reduce the need to chmod the binaries. I don't think the Rust code
is more complex than the bash.

CM: As a passing thought - the script for the guides should be handled
by guidemaker in the future. Technically guidemaker should be useable by everyone.
So deleting things in that script is a hack. We should minimize what the
script needs to do. 

RM: Sounds good! I have also been thinking of ways to automate the process.
The release blog post is in the tool, and it's just a reminder at this point.
We could make an automated GitHub action that creates a new blog post.

JW: This reminds me that we need to make the 4.0 blog post draft

RM: Mixonic is working on this, so talk to him

JW: good idea, thank you!

### Design for esnote feedback

https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/issues/307

Looking good! We like option #1. Ship it and then see how it looks in context
in the tracking branch/preview.
