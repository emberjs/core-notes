## Topics

### GitHub Issues Beta
We just got access to the new GitHub Issues Beta. Are there ideas we could try to improve our handling of issues?
For example:
- Replace our tracking sheet with a project + automation
- Create "help wanted" or "good first issue" boards for our org

RM: I added this topic more to bring awareness and so we think about how we can improve and help our management
CM: üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Ember 4.0 (all, 10 mins)

What do we still need to do?

JW: what I think needs to happen:
- fill out deprecation stubs
- PR to add deprecation links into ember source code
- we have to be involved in the blog post
- we've done some QA of the guides, so we should be ok
- we need to finish QA on the API docs
- what is our communication strategy?

JW: I started going over API docs
RM: send me the PRs so I can help

JW: going back to communication strategy
JW: our main focus is editions but the JS community pays attention to major releases
JW: Communications strategy:
- Twitter official account
- dev.to (will automatically syndicate)
- reddit
- hackernews?
- JavaScript weekly, FrontEnd weekly
- Ask people to blog
- A followup blog post with vision & inspirational stuff
- podcasts

### Upcoming cookbook RFC (JW, 10 mins)

JW: I've been hearing from users that they'd like more complete examples
JW: we've talked about having more tutorials and include examples that way but it hasn't happened yet

- ember-learn org
- not versioned with the guides
