## Topics

### Deprecation Staging RFC review (15min)
https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0649-deprecation-staging.html

Team discussion of the RFC and how it impacts learning team processes and the deprecation app.

### Showcase (Learn page) and Examples
https://emberjs.com/learn/

These pages haven't been updated in a while. Questions:
- Do we want to keep them around?
- If so, do we want to keep both the inline showcase and the standalone page?
- Should they display the same items?
