## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->

### page-title API docs

- https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19489
- https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19490

Action: Do the same as we did for RSVP.

### Create Ember Data landing page (API Docs)
PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/746

JW: the ticket was scoped to writing the content.
JW: I was hoping it would be easy to make it actually show but it wasn't the case.
JW: I need help getting the page showing with fastboot.

Action: Help JW get it running.

### ember-json-api-docs

AL added in this topic from last week, since seems like still needs action:

- [ ] Action item for next release: Heroku-related: JW says there has been some bug fixes to ember-json-api-docs, but a fix from lifeart (https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97) was missing. Can we be sure to do a pull in the next release? RM checked out the tool code (https://github.com/ember-learn/tool-new-release), which now clones from GitHub, so we're not sure why it didn't pull. Perhaps can do it once locally to fix old generated docs and ensure that ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97 gets in?

Action: Keep an eye out when doing the next release.
