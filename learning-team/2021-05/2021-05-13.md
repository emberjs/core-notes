## Topics

### https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/755 Heroku woes, ember-api-docs hasn't been deployed in a year. (AL, 5? Can also track down who best to ping.)

- CM says Heroku's Ember build pack is broken. We cannot depend on Heroku's build pack. A fork of Heroku has worked for Ember Fastboot...but has a rolling memory leak problem. `ember-learn/ember-api-docs` is just the frontend of the "ember-api-docs" suite of repos. RM has more context on the issue and AL filled in on what she chatted with Heroku / Siva. JW asks do we have to use Heroku?
- RM said the code itself is the usual DSL stuff. Something about a version of Ruby that is supposed to be embedded.
- CM will add to the Fastboot agenda. Way forward is to stop using the Ember buildpack. CM will ask the Fastboot working group how best to do that and see if will get some progress on that. The solution (theoretically) is to use the Node buildpack instead of the Ember buildpack, which will run a `npm build` and `npm start`. But that is not enough for a Fastbooted Ember app to be considered Ember ready. Then add it to the Fastboot docs. Fastbook PR for ref: https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-website/pull/116
- What the PR is doing is fixing if Glimmer segments have 2 or more slashes, they 404 in production.
- [ ] Action item: AL will drop the Heroku testing commits and merge the PR, then create a new PR to fix Heroku stuff.
- JW can we deploy the ember-api-docs thru AWS or something? Perhaps through GitHub sponsorship? We can't be in a non-deploying state in 4.0.
- [ ] Action item: CM and RM will meet and talk about this next Thursday.

### ember-json-api-docs

- [ ] Action item for next release: Heroku-related: JW says there has been some bug fixes to ember-json-api-docs, but a fix from lifeart (https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97) was missing. Can we be sure to do a pull in the next release? RM checked out the tool code (https://github.com/ember-learn/tool-new-release), which now clones from GitHub, so we're not sure why it didn't pull. Perhaps can do it once locally to fix old generated docs and ensure that ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97 gets in?
