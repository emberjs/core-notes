### ember-json-api-docs

AL added in this topic as carryover, so don't forget? Am not sure who does the next release

- [ ] Action item for next release: Heroku-related: JW says there has been some bug fixes to ember-json-api-docs, but a fix from lifeart (https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97) was missing. Can we be sure to do a pull in the next release? RM checked out the tool code (https://github.com/ember-learn/tool-new-release), which now clones from GitHub, so we're not sure why it didn't pull. Perhaps can do it once locally to fix old generated docs and ensure that ember-jsonapi-docs/pull/97 gets in?

Action: Keep an eye out when doing the next release.
