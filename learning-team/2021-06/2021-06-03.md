## Topics

### Carry over from last week

AL note: Wasn't sure if anything from https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes/blob/master/learning-team/2021-05/2021-05-27.md needed to be carried over.

### Current website redesign project

CM: current website redesign project that I mentioned if anyone wants to claim an item in the To Do column https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/45

### Method from external library

RM: ember-page-title is on ember-api-docs site. But it comes from an external library

https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers

- example: https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.26/functions/rsvp/filter
- current link (is): https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/v3.26.1/node_modules/rsvp/lib/rsvp/filter.js#L42
- correct link (should be): https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/blob/master/lib/rsvp/filter.js#L42

### Add Contextual Components to the Guides? (CM, 10m)

https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/patterns-for-components/#toc_contextual-components doesn't actually cover the idea of contextual components as they are understood today.

@nickschot has a simple example and might have some ideas on content

ember-api-docs doesn't have anchors, but may have a section on contextual components

Refer to this talk from Miguel Cambia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFudGJn2J0

When you yield a component

RM shares an example from Addepar/ember-table. Note: is using curlies. https://github.com/addepar/ember-table#template
