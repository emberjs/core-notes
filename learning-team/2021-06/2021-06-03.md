## Weekly review

### Review action items (weekly)

See: [Action items board](https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/47)

RM has a couple things but no update for this week.

### Review Initiatives board (every other week)

See: [Initiatives board](https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/33) or update for [2021 initiatives board](https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/51)

JW asks about RFC tracking in stages, RM doesn't know yet.

- [ ] Action item: AL could update this in the template to include both, and member list.

### Review PR queue

See: [tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPyN9z9wZMpTNwqCfa6R9QSPZkIW4iQd-H4gZC7ILLk/edit#gid=2035777454)

- RM is not sure how to change the bot to ignore a PR, so we continue to ignore

- RM: beginning of the JSONAPIAdapter#findMany discussion https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480501977931972608/844951413665562635

## Topics

### Carry over from last week (AL)

AL note: Wasn't sure if anything from https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes/blob/master/learning-team/2021-05/2021-05-27.md needed to be carried over.

### Current website redesign project (CM)

CM: current website redesign project that I mentioned if anyone wants to claim an item in the To Do column https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/45

### Method from external library (RM)

RM: ember-page-title is on ember-api-docs site. But it comes from an external library

https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers

- example: https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.26/functions/rsvp/filter
- current link (is): https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/v3.26.1/node_modules/rsvp/lib/rsvp/filter.js#L42
- correct link (should be): https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/blob/master/lib/rsvp/filter.js#L42

### Add Contextual Components to the Guides? (CM, 10m)

https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/patterns-for-components/#toc_contextual-components doesn't actually cover the idea of contextual components as they are understood today.

@nickschot has a simple example and might have some ideas on content

ember-api-docs doesn't have anchors, but may have a section on contextual components

Refer to this talk from Miguel Cambia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFudGJn2J0

When you yield a component

RM shares an example from Addepar/ember-table. Note: is using curlies. https://github.com/addepar/ember-table#template

JW we should teach it, but is an advanced Ember move, so something to keep in mind.

Ankush: This is also a good resource for learning in-depth: https://embermap.com/topics/contextual-components. JG says Ember Map has an Octane version behind paywall.

CM can create an issue and put in the code samples for NS.

JW: make sure we always have a section for "Contextual Components". Don't rename "Contextual Components" to "Components" and lose that. 

RM: ember-api-docs has it, but uses curlies. 

### ember-api-docs (JW)

JW has been working on this with runspired CT. Sharing this PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pull/763. Is a huge PR due to the complicated nature of the app, so wants to walk through the PR since it will be very large / hard to review. Making atomic commits when possible, review commit-by-commit.

See https://www.jenweber.dev/remodeling-an-ember-app---introduction/ from Ankush in channel, relevant blog post. Wants to use less of Ember Data! Regular JS => JSON API format.

RM things it's ok and looks forward to reading next JW post with CT. 

CM tends to "hyper prefer" simpler solutions that are more standard Ember vs. off the beaten path, preserve shoebox capability. Jen will add this to her personal Notion doc. Preserve shoebox so keep the door open for re-rendering.
