## Topics

### Revisit the 2021 initiatives (JW)

Talk about things that we didn't cover due to no EmberConf IRL face-to-face the last couple years, due to pandemic.

Here is the doc, needs core team access: https://www.notion.so/emberteam/February-2021-94a6185776aa4e27a83444a50dc08c46. We are filling out updates there.

Action items:

- CM, AL: Work on "Ember in the wider community" for Learning Team session in ~1mo
- JW, AL: Potentially have an Ember Times coworking session event to get more writers
