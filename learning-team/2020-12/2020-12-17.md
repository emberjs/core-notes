## Topics

### Ember 3.23 release (RM, 10min)
RM: I updated tool-new-release, it now covers Guides, API Docs and the Blog Post.
RM: it also creates a release in GitHub and uploads the binaries there to make instructions easier
RM: I'm updating the instructions in the handbook and the tool

JG: any stragglers that still need to be done?
RM: no, API docs eventually updated properly, and Glitch was having some problems but also resolved itself.

### ember-blog redesign

CM, JW: we'll do a release party on Saturday after Ember Times is published
