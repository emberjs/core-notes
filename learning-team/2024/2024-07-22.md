## Topics

### Work on some “Help wanted” issues - a number of people have come looking to help but we don’t have a good list right now <@mansona>

- CM: the https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/ website doesn't really serve us
- should we just be telling people to use a [github search](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aember-learn+org%3Aember-cli+org%3Aadopted-ember-addons+org%3Aemberjs+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aopen+&type=issues&query=org%3Aember-learn+is%3Aissue&s=created&o=desc)
- we don't have an "all issues" view in help-wanted
- AG: we can probably add this kind of view to the help-wanted
- BD: i have recently started using Ember and I wanted to help the onboarding process of Ember
- I don't have any background knowledge so i can help with the first-look of docs
- AG: there are a bunch of things that don't recommend that are still in the guides
- (discussion about Polaris)

### ViteConf partnering? Next step <@IgnaceMaes>

- (discussion about the requirements of ViteConf partnering)
- CM: reach out to Leah to double check if there is an issue

### @action vs. arrow functions <@IgnaceMaes> https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888/1263926680226107552

- (discussion about the contents of the question)
- conclusion: it's probably fine for us to encourage an RFC and have deeper discussion there
