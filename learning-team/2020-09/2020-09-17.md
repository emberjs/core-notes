## Topics

### Let's discuss updating Ember's wikipedia page, see discord discussion here. (JG, 10min)

https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888/755379525667389472

- jen mentioned that it wasn't as hard to do as we might think (not a lot of push back)
- RM: plan what we want to say in the wikipedia
- RM: also we should think about what the Vue comparison page says and update https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#Ember
  - probably coordinate with the steering committee
- JG: at a minumum we should keep the current version in sync on wikipedia
  - also there is no mention of Octane or Editions
  - RM: update it by linking to resources on the Ember website
  - CM: is this an initiative
  - RM: if we include other resources (like the stack overflow tag description etc)
  - CM: if we're going to engage the community then I think this should be an initiative

### Feedback for Ember Guides (IL, 10 min)

In the Ember Guides, we use the `+` and `-` to indicate what code have been added or deleted. For example, in the [Super Rentals Tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/orientation/#toc_editing-files-and-live-reload) (and other pages), we might see,

<img width="480" alt="The Ember Guides uses plus and minus symbols to show code changes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16869656/93392480-7995bc00-f836-11ea-953e-d0161a7538f8.png">

A developer provided me feedback that 2 interns that they were mentoring weren't sure how to read such code. The developer explained to me that the interns weren't yet familiar with diff tools that we might regularly use on GitHub.

For more complex code (think about a large code review that you might have had to do), I think it's also possible that showing many changes with `+` or `-` may not be the best way to convey the changes.

I wondered if we can **update the code block component** to either:

- Provide a help button that, when clicked, explains how to read code with `+` and `-`
- Provide an option to see Before and After side-by-side (Ã  la [Octane cheat sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/))

Notes: 
- IL: is this feedback that we have had before
- RM: I personally don't like the diff and find it confusing
- CM: I seem to remember that most people didn't like the diffs
- IL: where does this component live?
  - CM: it's complicated
  - the future is https://github.com/empress/ember-showdown-prism
  - there are some techinical (and other) reasons why we might not want to do some heavy implemention like tabs for code blocks
  - shouldn't be too hard to add an info button 
- CM: how do we move forward to remove these diffs
- IL: we would at least need some coordination with godfry
- we will check with the rest of the team to see if we're ok with just removing the diffs
