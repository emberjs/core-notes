### Feedback for Ember Guides (IL, 10 min)

In the Ember Guides, we use the `+` and `-` to indicate what code have been added or deleted. For example, in the [Super Rentals Tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/orientation/#toc_editing-files-and-live-reload) (and other pages), we might see,

A developer provided me feedback that 2 interns that they were mentoring weren't sure how to read such code. The developer explained to me that the interns weren't yet familiar with diff tools that we might see on GitHub.

For more complex code (think about a large code review that you might have had to do), I think it's also possible that showing many changes with `+` or `-` may not be the best way to convey the changes.

I wondered if we can **update the code block component** to either:

- Provide a help button that, when clicked, explains how to read code with `+` and `-`
- Provide an option to see Before and After side-by-side (Ã  la [Octane cheat sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/))
