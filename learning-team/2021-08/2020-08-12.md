## Topics

### CSS for the Tutorial

https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/1709

- The new page would go right after Orientation
- Devashish is working on a blueprint for generating the files. This will take a lot of time. A little stuck on this. @mansona might be able to help!
- It's not documented how to achieve blueprints for addons - this could be improved in the CLI guides
- Adding a new page can move forward!

Next steps:
- Open a separate issue in the Guides and tutorial repo for adding the new page
- Devashish will write the page. @jenweber is happy to help review!
