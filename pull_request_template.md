## EmberJS Open Meeting Notes


### Meeting Info

<!-- Replace the ALL CAPS information with the relevant data for the meeting -->
- Meeting: EVENT NAME
- Date: DATE
- Facilitator: NAME (GITHUB USERNAME)

### Agenda

Agendas have two sections: 

1. Standing items: should happen every meeting
2. Additional discussion: for any other topic to be discussed

#### Standing Item: General Admin

<!-- Facilitator notes: -->
<!-- Ask these questions and document if there are responses -->
<!-- If any of these questions have a YES response, please also post to the core meta channel in Discord. -->

- Any new, known blockers for our users in ember-source?
- Any show-stopping [issues](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues) that need more immediate attention?
- Any [pull requests](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pulls) that needs more urgent review?

#### Standing Item: RFC Review

<!-- Facilitator notes: 

Review each type of RFC PR and determine if there are any **NEW** comments or feedback.
Document discussion (the general gist) in these notes.
Try to document concerns raised in the RFC PR itself.

Important note: it may not be possible to get through each section in a single meeting, that's fine!
You can determine as the facilitator what is most useful for that meeting.
