## Topics

### Broccoli PR <@kategengler>

- https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli/pull/510
- looks good
- approved but we don't have permissions

### Move release-plan, etc to release-plan org? @kategengler

- done! 

### vite codemod improvements <@ef4>

- long discussion about various improvements
- we shouldn't warn on non-actionable v2 addons
- ember-cli-mirage -> ember-mirage migration is painful
- CM: the main blocker was not having import.meta.glob
- EF: that shouldn't be a blocker - we should have functions that can have requirejs.entries be passed to it
- CM: soft agree, but I feel like unifying on import.meta.glob might be better

### app blueprint glint by default <@void-malex>

- discussion about having a good experience for people using JS only
- (long discussion)
- EF: it would be great if we could have glint VS use a bundled version from the plugin

<5 mins> Vite ecosystem CI - typescript errors <@mansona>
<10 mins> (at the end) Shipping Polaris - timeline? Is it just when all RFCs are Recommended? <@mansona>
