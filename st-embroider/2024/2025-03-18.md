### Breaking type changes in 6.4 <@ef4>

- https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20876

- EF: it's a very global setting, I have had it in two small apps/addons
- isn't a one line change to add the types back
- PS: yes. the resoning was that ts supports exports for quite some time
- EF: this could be solved by dropping the dependency on ember-soruce and rollup up the types into our build
- (discussion about adding back in the types entry in package.json)
- (agreement that we should try it)
- CM: this will be a patch update of the glimmer packages
-
