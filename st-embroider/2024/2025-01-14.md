## Topics

### Project planning 

- (discussing the "ship everything in app blueprint as a v2 addon")
  - clarification - this now referring to the vite v2 app blueprint since that's going to be the default soon
- inversion of controll for webpack
  - a bit of progress because hbs resolution is in core now
- rfc for v2 addon 
  - progress on the minimal template
  - testing can start again 

### new blueprints: drop support for (stop testing against) yarn@1? Just do it? RFC? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: is this the v2 addon blueprint
- PS: yes
- EF: it's find to do that
- CM: we should error if someone tries to generate an addon with yarn
- (all agreed)

### jest -> vitest for ember-template-lint <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/pull/3100
- (discussion about the PR)
- (general agreement that it's ok)
- CM: maybe just double check that the same number of tests were run? 
- (general agreement)

### Blueprint RFC discussion - do we need an RFC? <@mansona>

- (long discussion - sorry I was talking too much to take many notes)
- (general concerns)
  - we need to make sure that versions mean things in ember-cli
  - we can't just have things floating without any benefit, otherwise we are moving the problem around
  - if this is so that we can release quicker then the problem is that we need to be able to release ember-cli faster without a blocker
- (things that Chris is trying to achieve)
  - yes release quicker, but I think it's reasonable to move CI for blueprints out of ember-cli
  - I think having a carat dependency could work but and make sure that our test matrix is right
  - I'm happy to have to PR a change of version to ember-cli to get things released 
- (observations)
  - `ember g` and `ember new` are different semantics
  - ember g should always use "local versions" 
  - it could be ember-source that defines the blueprint version because that's more scemantic anyway
- general consensus is that we probably should have an RFC to accurately express the plan
