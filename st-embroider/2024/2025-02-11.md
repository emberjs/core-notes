## Topics

### review again https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2046 (@patricklx)


### Merge plz? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2259 (@mansona)

- EF: test-setup needs to be private too
- very soon we need tag to be per package
- 

### Typescript feature flag conclusion from the learning team meeting - Aim for nested flags but use it sparingly <@mansona>

- EF: at learning team meeting we discussed the feedback from attempts to use the proposed plan for feature flags
- having a permenant typescript flag for all parts of the code will be hard to write docs for
- as a TS user I'm ok with having a TS section at the bottom 
- does anyone have any strong objection
- KH: happy to have that
- PW: also happy
- EF: CM also mentioned that we could have nested feature flags anyway, he intends to implement the feature anyway

### [Tooling tangent!] Where should the implementation of @glimmer/tracking/primitives/storage go? <@NullVoxPopuli> @glimmer/validator? 

- PS: using the primatives is a lot faster 
- I want to be able to make it available but I don't know where to put it
- ember has re-exported things in the past, will we just do that?
- EF: what you're proposing isn't making things worse

### Can we merge the remaining things for the alpha release now? <@mansona>

- (lots of hacking on the vite config issue)
