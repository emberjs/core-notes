## Topics

### Project Planning

- type=module quest - PS: I will re-run all the reproductions to check the current state of things

### @embroider/util PR - https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2480 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: I thought I deleted this
- CM: no we just made it private so we don't release
- PS: I will PR deleting this

### Fixing regexes for splitAtRoutes https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2458 <@mansona>

- (worked on it in office hours)
- CM: I made the suggested fix
- EF: merged

### importSync is overly eager - https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2471 macros issue

- (discussion)
- EF: chris commented on this, do we need to do anything else
- CM: we really should not do anything until the known problem is fixed
- (all agree)
- EF: we really need to make it clear that `@embroider/macros` should be used very sparingly as a means to get over a non-breaking migration but we should be moving to `import()` apis going forward


### Test scenarios failures on Windows with newer Ember Data <robbytx>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2473 
- (long discussion)
- It turns out that in mac and linux vite deps are considered with the owner as the app
- on windows this isn't the case (for some reason)
- This is what throws the error: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/main/packages/macros/src/babel/state.ts#L81-L87
- EF: in this case (for ember-data) it is an opertunistic check and shouldn't throw
- the solution is to go through the code and see what is using the function `owningPackage()` 


### type=module by default in both addon and app <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: it works for new apps and addons
- EF: does it work if you use macros with vite? 
- we need to update the original issue to make sure we know what works and what doesn't
- PS: I will update the issue
