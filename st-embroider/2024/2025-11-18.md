## Topics

### 

### review localCopy custom comparator PR and merge? Is this our remit? (we asked about this before) <@mansona on behalf of @simonihmig>

- https://github.com/tracked-tools/tracked-toolbox/pull/226
- (long discussion about this)
- change looks fine - the library is sus
- KG: I've seen localCopy in the wild but nothing else
- EF: we can merge this now but we should deprecate the lib
- CM: do we need a blog post

### release-plan <@gossi>

- release-plan as critical infra piece (esp. with trusted publishing) and its support - this is not backed by enough capacity
- Merge release-plan and github-changelog repos into one?
- (discusson about the benefits and drawbacks)


### Initial conversation about splitAtRoutes - how to configure sibling routes into the same bundle that is not the main bundle <@mansona>

- CM: description of the problem
- A: our previous discussion says we shouldn't be adding custom things in the embroider, we should do it in the Vite way
- EF: yes but splitAtRoutes is the thing that generates the code that vite looks at to generate the bundles
- we could look at providing some lower level things that could be used to define the behaviour
- maybe we should provide a stable API for the globals that embroider router loads so they can be produced in a different way
