## Topics

### clarification on output repos - didnâ€™t we say we wanted to have it only do the defaults (i.e. not one for `@ember-tooling/classic-build-app-blueprint` and `@ember/app-blueprint`). <@mansona>

- See https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/10792 
- CM: (explaining the question he was looking for clarification)
- CM: we're ok with there being a diff in the new output between 6.7 and 6.8
- KG: doesn't need to be a new repo, we can use a tag for the classic blueprint

### ember-data is broken on the ember-cli@6.4 (bad versions). Should we put effort into fixing it since itâ€™s LTS? <@mansona>

- Ember-data version is 5.4
- @ember-data/* versions are 5.3 (only installed in typescript) https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/v6.4.0/blueprints/app/files/package.json#L34-L43
- Updating `@ember-data/*` to 5.4 breaks because `@ember-data/graph@5.4` never released 
- (general discussion): we should probably fix this
- CM: we can't fix this unless ember-data release the missing package
- KG: at the very least you can create an issue


### change @embroider/macros to query via resolve, rather than package.json <@NullVoxPopuli>

- Ref: https://github.com/tracked-tools/tracked-built-ins/pull/440 
- PS: we need to maybe add a macro that tells you what version of ember the app is using
- EF: we could add appDependencySatisfies
- CM: we narrowed the question to ember-source for a reason, so we don't mess with the dependency graph for more cases than we need to
- EF: yes that's right, this is why we were strict about peers in the dependencySatisfies()


<5 mins> can I remove all the strange functionality of ember-cli-update ðŸ™ˆ what does init do? Why do we need `install <addon>`? What is `save`? And why is it different from `bootstrap`!?
<5 mins> walk through of the change in the tests for the VITE experiments <@mansona>
<5 mins> optimizeDeps perf: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2548 <@NullVoxPopuli>
