## Topics

### Do we need to fix pod support in our tests https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-blueprint-test-helpers/issues/395  <@mansona>

- (recap on the spec discussion about deprecating pods)
- EF: if someone wants to fix those tests that's fine
- commented on the issue

### vite fix custom base url https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2046 <@patricklx>

- (recapping the change)
- EF: the fix looks good
- do we really need a new scenario with a full matrix for this test?
- (discussion about doing this only on one version)
- (discussion about putting it into an existing scenario)
- requested changes in the PR

### Should we add an optional feature for the “each hack” for routable components. I.e. navigate to the same route with a different model will destroy the component (maybe this is a spec meeting topic?) <@mansona>

- (discussion about the situation)
- EF: we could do this as an option but we might want to do this route-by-route
- This would be more like a route manager conversation i.e. a new base class would have a new behaviour
- it would be nice to have it in the routable components feature (currently in beta) but it's too far from the RFC's stated goals
- CM: and I wouldn't want to back out the routable components implementation to make a new RFC
- EF: agreed

### Discussion about releasing glimmer better

- (long discussion)
