## Topics

### Project Updates

- Long discussion about v2 addons by default - tracked builtins etc.
- discussion about testing v1 addons with vite
  - CM maybe we push on v2 addon by default work?
  - added to the agenda
- 


### lingering engines issue that was asked about in discord. <@ef4>

- https://github.com/ember-engines/ember-engines/pull/901 

- EF: seems like we should update this
- A: we should do ember-cli-update to keep changes in line with upstream
- EF: we need to make sure these changes are included when the update is done
- we need some decision on what happens next
- this PR looks landable 



### re-review codemod upgrade to commander - check that we’re happy with api changes (see the test update) https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2320 <@mansona>

- looks mostly ok
- EF: I don't like the `--no-` prefix, can we change it?
- CM: I'll see what I can do


### mo’minimal <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2339 
- PS: it would be nice to remove ember-cli
- (general agreement)
- we need to find some way to run tests rather than `ember test` 
- testem is still good
  

### v2 addon by default - non monorepo testing spike <@mansona>

- https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/my-v2-ember-addon-test-with-tests-test
- EF: we could consider using vite build rather than having a rollup build
- this would benefit from the more minmal resolver
- 

### ember-cli-deprecation-workflow as v2 <@simon>

- (summary of the issue)
- we want to upgrade the addon
- EF: it's probably time to introduce an optional feature flag to move all the ember source out of vendor
- this would mean that anything in vendor that depended on deprecate would be broken rather than missed
- a v2 addon can inject code into vendor using the implicit scripts metadata in package.json
- you can see that we're rewriting it already to embroider so we can compare that in embroider
- 

### stable decorators update - RFC etc. <@ef4>

- ran out of time, added to next week's agenda
