## Topics

No agenda today

### Looking into speed of building question

- CM: https://github.com/mainmatter/build-start-rebuild-perf
- we're looking into build speeds to keep them at least the same as before
- PS: I'm looking into improving number of reloads during depScan
- https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/limber/pull/1968

### reviewing the embroider roadmap

- 2 topics that are ready for people to work on if anyone has the time
  - deprecate non-serialisable babel plugins
  - Deprecate app.import
- just writing the deprecation guides can make a massive difference

### discussion about slow tests

- A: 3x slowdown
- (long discussion about possible problems)
- A: I'll go and try some of the suggestions and report back

### Render assertion

- https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm/issues/1762
- (long discussions)
- Main take-away: 
  - don't ever set tracked state during a render (we should bake the assertion more strict)
  - you should never create tracked state from tracked state. You should refactor it to be a getter
