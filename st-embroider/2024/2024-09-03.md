## Topics

### Divergence between app-template and app-blueprint: https://github.com/embroider-build/app-blueprint/pull/58 should we be importing without a suffix? <@mansona>

- (discussion of the issue)
- EF: with type=module we should have extensions
- we don't need to make sure that the app-template and the app-blueprint need to be exactly in sync, template can be more minimal (fewer dependencies)

### Corner Ed in to reviewing https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/1486 ‚ù§Ô∏è <@NullVoxPopli>

- PS: i should remove the externals array
- EF: it doesn't hurt
- CM: probably better to keep so people on slightly earlier embroider versions don't get broken
- (discussion of the PR)
- PS: a lot of this code is to support versions pre ember-source@2.8 ü´†
- (discussion about the packageRules block)
- PS: we can remove that in a follow up PR to clean up and modernise the tests

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1855 <@patricklx>  needsSyntheticComponentJS change

- (review of the PR)
- (discussion about targeting stable)


### decide on the fate of the dummy app (for now) <@mansona>

- right now they work because app rewriting smooths the issues
- we're dropping app rewriting so getting vite to understand dummy apps is quite difficult with little benefit
- we need a plan to get ember-try scenarios if we move away from supporting dummy apps if we want addons to test
- alternatively we could keep app-rewriting support and only use it for dummy apps but this could make things quite complex
- PS: I don't think it's worth it to support them
- CM: I would prefer if we could keep the ember-try scenarios working without needing dev intervention
- EF: it would be possible for ember-cli-update to add required files
- CM: that's assuming that people will be using ember-cli-update to upgrade their blueprint and not just `@embroider/test-support` 
- EF: yes this is the decision that we need to make, how much work do we want to do in ember-try etc.
- CM: any objections from the room? 
- (no response)

<5 mins> Thoughts on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2086 <@simonihmig>
<5 min> summarize discussion of dummy app support <@ef4>
<5 mins> v2 app RFC discussion - specifically the motivation section <@mansona>

### motivations of v2 app RFC
- EF: I still think that a new authoring standard *must* be motivated by following clear standards that don't depend on ember-cli or node, such that newly-written code that follows the new standard can reasonably be expected to work in the future in other environments. Whether or not our current implementaiton exists in other environments is separate from the question of what goes into the spec.

### v2 app blueprint in ember-cli
- PS: asked whether we'd really want to move v2 app blueprint into ember-cli, it's nice to develop separately
- EF: Yeah, even when it's default it could be maintained in separately repo and ember-cli releases would gate when a new version of the blueprint becomes default
