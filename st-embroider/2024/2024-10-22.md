## Topics

### Embroider Roadmap discussions

- https://github.com/orgs/embroider-build/projects/1/views/1

- progress made on the shipping ember-source as v2
- progress being made on converting all addons in blueprint as v2
  - we need to make sure that v2 addons don't have classic addons as dependencies
- progress being made on the webpack inversion of control plugin
  - currently testing it out with unplugin
  - EF: last time I checked virtual files didn't work all too well
  - PS: that works now
  - EF: it's worth trying it out

### Thoughts on https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2155? <@simonihmig>

- EF: generally a good idea
- CM: do we want to change this like this in a way that can't change in the future?
- EF: this reminds me about our work on this before
- we need to consider the timing on this
- (discussion on how babel config is collected right now)
- we might prefer to have a macros config that had a better author format and we would provide a function for compat loading
- this PR won't actually work in a non-prebuild app
- (discussion about targeing main/stable and opting in to the new behaviour)
- Probably going to hold off merging this
- next steps: working to make macros driven by its own config
- "push it ever later" 
- there is a lot of code in here to make sure timing is right
- if we can convert this to pull based that would be better
- assume you have a babel config, that has a macro plugin in it, that would load its config from a file
- CM: how about trying a spike against main and then trying to port it back from there?
- EF: sounds good
- it's easier to play with and design this feature on main
- there is an argument that settings for embroider macros just happens in your babel config

### content-tag fixes <@wagenet>

### bp upgrade shock - lack of changes trickling through to it (recent experience with e-template-lint) <@void-mAlex>
