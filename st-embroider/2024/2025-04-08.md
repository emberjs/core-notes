## Topics

### Compatibility issues post stable release <@ef4>

- CM: should we do anything in the tracking issue: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1860
- (discussion about webpack plugin)
- (discussion about adding a better error for people)
- A: we can release a new patch of `@embroider/webpack` that is "marked" in some way that we can throw an error in modern `@embroider/compat`
- EF: yes let's do that

- (discussion about app.import with custom output paths)
- KG: can we just deprecate the whole app.import
- EVERYONE: YES!!
- (added to the board)

- we should try to turn back on engines tests with no fastboot
- CM: we discuss doing this in the engines repo before because they have more runtime tests
- that would stop us from having to update the build tests we currently have

- (long discussion about how to implement fastboot support)
- (general agreement that we should try to make this work via fastboot-app-server)
- CM: I'll take a look at it
- EF: we want to push forward on native SSR
