## Topics

### Releasing @glimmer/component update for this DX improvement https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/21014 <@evoactivity>

- EF: since the merge we might not have the automation to release this automatically
- KG: I will need to check that it isn't being automatically caught by our new CI
- PS: maybe release plan just for some packages? 
- CM: maybe 🙈
- KG: I have a few ideas

### who owns https://github.com/emberjs/ember-cli-babel ? shouldn’t that be the Tooling team? <@mansona>

- CM: all been solved
- just trying to get rid of npm deprecations
- more on this later

### PRs from nvp <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2664 
- merged
  
- https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/2190 
- merged

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2662 
- PS: I can probably add docs before merging but I wanted to get a sense of the correct implementation
- EF: looks a lot better
- why are we adding the types to the public API? we probably don't want to have this added to the public api
- (discussion about the actual implemntation and the timing of when things happen)
- (discussion about it being always runtime)
- A: I would be in favour of always runtime
- EF: that would prevent you from branch elimination for production
- we wouldn't need it to be a macro then
- (discussion of the specifics of the implementation)
- comment about updating the error to be an assertion that the global and the argument to the setTesting() match (you can't toggle it at runtime)

### can I get a review and merge on https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli-concat/pull/171 ? is it a decent way to revive a legacy codebase like this? <@mansona>

- (discussion of the CI approach)
- all agreed that this is ok
- KG: should we just do a major quickly

### update on the install new app with no npm deprecations situation <@mansona>  

- sumamry of the strategy
- some overrides that have been used so far to make it better:

```

- (discussion of the problem with source-map-url)
- EF: happy to inline
- 

### ember-table v1 addon migration - anyone have connections to reach maintainers? <@void-mAlex>

- https://github.com/Addepar/ember-table/pull/1203
- https://github.com/Addepar/ember-table/pull/1173
- A: summary of the situation
- I'm happy to do the work if we can get access
- CM: I am pushing on the v2 addon by default RFC so that we can have a codemod that pushes people in the right direction
- EF: remember that we can ship default compat adapters to prevent people being blocked
- A: better to upstream changes than monkeypatching in compat adapters
- CM: why not both!
- 

### @embroider/try scare with no readme or link to repository https://www.npmjs.com/package/@embroider/try  <@void-mAlex> 

- need to have a README and a back-link from the package.json 
- (discussion of backlash against npx)
- 

### any one have ideas for reducing the number of packages brought in by tiny tools? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://node-modules.dev/grid/depth#install=@embroider/macros 
- (large discussion about the benefit)
- CM: we could use e18e to optimise
- EF: we should focus on common things like `@embroider/addon-shim` that would be good
- for decorator-transforms we could minimise the graph by having a separate runtime package
- CM: we should consider upgrading things like broccoli-plugin to be esm only and then following that upgrade up the graph (broccoli-funnel, addon-shim)
- (all agreed)
