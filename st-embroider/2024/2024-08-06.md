## Topics

### Embroider Roadmap discussion

- Almost there on the vite stuff. Two more steps
  - stop declaring app as auto-upgraded
  - stop flattening the app and test folders
- discussion about v2 addon RFC - simple app booting

### template compiler issue in ember-source https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20718 <@mansona>

- EF: the way that it used to work needs to continue to work
- KG: should this block the release patch? 
- EF: no go ahead
- the patch is very important
- we could debug the issue on the call if we have time

### Glint generic components <@ef4>

- EF: it's not possible to make components that are generic over their components
- PW: what's the issue? it's just the template only component that has the issue
- EF: we could implement some way to use class syntax to define a "template only component" only for the types
- the issue is that we only have 2 base classes `@ember/component` and `@glimmer/component` which both have behaviours
- we could implement some other base class that gives us the ability to define generics
- we could also reuse the techinque in ember-route-template used
