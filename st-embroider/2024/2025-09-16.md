## Topics

### can I remove all the strange functionality of ember-cli-update üôà <@mansona>
### can we remove fixing ember-cli-update as a condition for Vite by default <@mansona>

- what does init do? Why do we need `install <addon>`? What is `save`? And why is it different from `bootstrap`!?
- (long discussion about how bad the codebase is)
- CM: we have spent more time on this than I wanted. If we need to draw a line under it what can we do?
- KG: I think it's fine to just throw an error and tell people to upgrade to 6.7 before upgrading
- CM: we would need to backport the blueprint update to do this
- (all agreed) that's fine
- CM: we will work another half day on this and if we can't solve it then we will go with this plan


### walk through of the change in the tests for the VITE experiments <@mansona>

- (general summary) we need to make sure we still test things after the VITE experiment goes away
- EF: left a review on the original PR that added the experiment. note: all the skips that were **not** commented need to be addressed
- added a PR to comment on the experiments so that if someone tries to remove the experiment they know to fix the issue üëç

### go-no-go criteria for Vite by default <@mansona>

- Bug to file: component test generator is adding ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile
- We should try running the vite codemod again
- We should run the app generator and do a full pass through it
- `ember test` is a trap (it builds but hangs, ever since `cwd: ‚Äúdist‚Äù` was added to testem.js)
- Document how to run tests against a production build
  - I tested what I thought would work and it hit a crash in content-for.js, 
- Add tests to ember-cli/ember-app-blueprint in windows
- Make the app-template in embroider be closer to `@ember/app-blueprint`
