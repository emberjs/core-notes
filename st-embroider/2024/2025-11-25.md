## Topics

### Review unreviewed PRs

#### Use replacers for eslint and babel to fix the full path display during project generation

- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-app-blueprint/pull/149

- (discussion) generally a good change
- CM: what's the value in adding this complexity to have it generate an app with newer node APIs
- (long discussion)
- (general agreement) we will remove that odd change and we can get this PR approved

### amd bundle deprecation, release issues <ef4>

- (long discussion about the merits and the way forward)
- (discussion of the required updates in people's apps)
- (general consensus that the trade offs are worth it and we can proceed)
- (general discussion) optional-features needs to be rearchitected so we can use it more effectively
  - it really should just be part of ember-source

### review "Embroider router support for ember source less than 4.12" <@void-mAlex>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2624  
- (general agreement) it's a good change
- (general discussion) so we don't have tests for embroider router in the embroider monorepo
- A: ember-engines has been a good test case for this and a few other things
- 

### first investigations into optional babel plugin <@mansona>

- (long discussion)
- CM: so we can only do macros and loose mode templates
- EF: all the logic of which one is loose and strict is defined in ember-babel-template-complication
- ultimately we want to implement these in 

### bug with app files causing cycles in typescript <@mansona>

- CM: should we probably just add app.ts to the list of ignored files?
- EF: we need to ignore all "resolvable extensions" of app - this is defined somewhere 
- CM: I'll take a look at this
