## Topics

### Project planning

- (discussion around ember-mirage topic - import.meta.glob specifics) - decision made to not implement in terms of requirejs.entries

### https://github.com/tildeio/simple-html-tokenizer/pull/114 <@patricklx>

- most likely ok
- might need a change of function name


### Fastboot upgrade path: planning and task breakdown <@ef4>

- fronts of the conversation
  - get vite ssr working for us in ideal situation
  - get a compatible verison for fastboot-app-server to consume
  - ssg case - full fastboot or full ssr might be overkill for most people - a puppeteer solution could be enough
- for vite srr
  - one side-quest that made this easier would be the minimal resolver in ember-source
- (discussion about the benefits of doing a fastboot-app-server)
- EF: I am testing with embroider on ssr: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/tree/ssr
