## Topics

### Is GJS ready to move to recommended now that the this blocker is fixed? <@mansona>

- CM: are we ready to start writing the guides with GJS
- (general discussion) - mostly agree that the time is now
- EF: template tag is a large cross cutting concern that it would make sense to do the work in one big change
- (general consensus that we can start the docs now)
- CM: when do we actually merge this? can we trickle in the features during the 6.4 branch?
- EF: we don't need a big reveal
- KG: we need to change some of the generators
- CM: how do we swap the defaults
- KG: if it's a optional feature we can backport it
- EF: we have to consider tooling too - alpha of glint
- CM: it depends on what you mean by tooling support - we need the alpha for glint for import discovery
- EF: we need to make sure the part of the docs that explains the situation

### terser? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the situation with decorators in esbuild)
- EF: we could work on rolldown based vite
- CM: action point
- PS: I will open a PR and we can discuss it there

### blueprint https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20835 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- work is progressing but it's not done yet

### addon-dev breaking changes https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2460 <@simonihmig>

- EF: this seems like a gap in documentation - the behaviour is correct to what we want to keep
- the usecase allows you to have a rollup plugin that can emit css and you can then keep those css in the addon output
- e.g. glimmer-scoped-css could have the same output plugin in both addons and apps
- SI: I can try and fill in the release-notes to explain this a bit more

### any ideas for debugging vite dep hell? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: getting to the bottom of the problem is often a process I haven't yet nailed down
- duplicate dependencies: is there a way to know
- EF: we need to probably fix the problems with the packages that can't be duplicated
- global state needs to be stored in globals not in module scope
- PS: glimmer component can be an issue here too 
- my solution has been to use pnpm public hoist pattern and an override
- A: I'll create a repro
- PS: I'll fix it

### updates on the blueprints - @ember/app-blueprint has a first pass now <@mansona>

- (overview of the two new blueprints)
- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-addon-blueprint/
- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-app-blueprint/
- CM: do we need hbs support? 
- EF: maybe not by default
- it would be nice if we had a way to easly add classic support
- we could use the embroider try apply to apply the classic scenario - or we could document it
- (discussion about ember-try and if embroider try is enough)
- CM: can we use embroider try for now
- KG: if we can use the same config then I wouldn't have any issue
- make it take a --config for the config file then we could point to the ember-try
- (further discussion)
