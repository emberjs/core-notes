## Topics

### Discussing Tracking issue for v4 release

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/1860
- updated all the checkboxes so they are correct
- (overview of all the topics)
- 


### Now that we’re releasing alphas do we need to be releasing unstable any more? <@mansona>

- Discussed in office-hours
- still a good thing
- not sure if we are causing buggy behaviour on npm by releasing unstable and alpha at the same time

### macros available in babel <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2249
- PS: suggestion was to merge options
- seems messy
- EF: if merging is too risky and annoying then we can error instead
- but it must be an error that someone can fix
- PS: what is the case that would throw an error? 
- EF: if an app did a setOwn config and babel config too 
- right now the thing that is dumped into the babel compat support is probably the output format not the input format
- we can probably fix that
- look in compat-app-builder -> addBabelCompat
- right now it's a portable babel config
- instead of running `babelPluginConfig()` before generating the file, do it later
- alternatively we could tell people to add their config to ember-cli-build so the merging would happen inside

### https://github.com/embroider-build/release-plan/pull/124 <@patricklx>

- merged

### https://github.com/embroider-build/github-changelog/pull/33 <@patricklx>

- merged

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2215 <@patricklx>

- the change in the PR is to limit the change to macros
- EF: this needs more looking into
- (added a comment to the issue)
- we need to find 

### Do we need a v2 app codemod to be in the embroider monorepo? My preference would be to not do that <@mansona>

- CM: I don't feel like it needs to be in the monorepo - easier to test etc.
- EF: can be separate
- 

### Resolve deprecation in page-title <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title/pull/293
- EF: looks like it's actually running ember 3.28 which won't work

### ember-respolver replacement? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: if we didn't want to do the import meta glob reformatting, where would something like this live?
- EF: it could be a different package
- or it could just be a feature of resolver
- I'm sensitive to not have too many package 
- we could just get it from `@embroider/core/resolver` a module that you can load into the browser
- i.e. we wouldn't make embroider core an addon
- I'm also fine for it to be standalone

<5 mins> can we remove ember-auto-import as a dependency of ember-source? https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20852 <@mansona>

<1 min> https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10633/ <@NullVoxPopuli>
