## Topics

### project planning

- [shipping everything in default app blueprint as v2](https://github.com/orgs/embroider-build/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=14430914) details has been updated recently
  - discussion of each of the remaining items
- v2 app spike is done - working on to specification
- v2 app rfc - discussion active
- vite plugin
  - what do we need to do to release
  - CM: we should start releasing a beta
  - it will help people with `^` dependencies
  - EF: does semver actually work correctly with this
  - CM: yes
- type=module support
  - EF: this is useful for us because it would enable Vite ssr support


### V2 App RFC review https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/977 

- Should we bundle the plugins

- EF: this feels like it's trying to be two things
- CM: that's why I strongly believe it should be two RFCs
- EF: the lean version of this is easier
- CM: but that means that people won't have v1 support
- we really need people to be able to install classic addons for a long time and it work
- (discussion of the merits)
- EF: I understand the point you're trying to make here
- CM: what else is there that we need to do here? 
- EF: we need to solve the `ember test` situation
- we can't have vite hard-coded in this
- also `@embroider/test-setup` is not valid right now on main
- we might need to add things to ember-try e.g. to be able to make a vite config for you

### generate the list of v1 addons that still remain in the v2 blueprint <@ef4>

- discussed during the project 

### poor state of eslint and prettier for gjs editor integrations <@void-mAlex>

- Apps in a slightly better state but it’s basically non existent/broken for v2 addons
- Els currently broken https://github.com/ember-tooling/ember-language-server/pull/418 
- ember-template-lint works on cli only

- A: at least for VSCode it's not a good situation
- EF: prettier is fixed, apart from one 
- eslint works
- (discussion about the difference between ember-template-lint and eslint)
- EF: we need a list of errors
- PS: we need a reproduction from Ember 6.1 without any
- (general agreement) the setup is very annoying

### v2 addon blueprint with ember-try bug https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/20777 <kmg>

### test app switch to always use strict embroider for test app for tracked built ins repo <@void-mAlex> https://github.com/tracked-tools/tracked-built-ins/pull/424
