## Topics

### Default dependencies in the addon-blueprint? https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint/issues/298 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion of the issue)
- EF: if we make them dependencies then we will have bigger apps (and some wrong apps)
- I'm ok with it not being in the default

### backport plan for https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10505 <@mansona>

- talking to Kelly about this, I can bring it up again next week if we don't get progress

### fixturify-project bug: https://github.com/stefanpenner/node-fixturify-project/pull/96 <@mansona>

- (discussion of the problem)
- EF: anything we change here will break somebody
- CM: we could provide a dual build of shared internals and that might fix things? 
- EF: that would still be breaking
- I supsect that one of the builds is actually broken
- we need to test both entrypoints to make sure this doesn't break something
- this made it a lot better in the monorepo: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2124
- try the Dual build and see if that fixes it
