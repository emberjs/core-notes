## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10613 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion about the motivation for this)
- EF: do we need a RFC for this
- (general agreement that we can go without RFC)
- KG: we lose the ability to track docs updates through the RFC process
- (general discussion that we need to make sure to update)

### https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/pull/3021 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- breaking change 
- this breaks the ability to lint or format the hbs-backtick support
- CM: I don't know if we should drop lint support like this
- EF: agree
- (discussion about previous architecture decisions of ember-template-lint)
- EF: I think we could come around to dropping hbs-backtick support 
- (log discussion about this)
- KG: do we have an eslint against using hbs-backticks? 
- (discussion about release order)
- KG: how likly is it to move things to eslint?
- (discussion about the implementation difficulty)
- EF: how many of the rules are actually broken because they aren't aware of scope
- PS: there are overrides that we are disabling for gjs right now: https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/blob/master/lib/config/recommended.js#L100-L126
- (updated the PR with a comment)

### https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/issues/92 <@davidtaylorhq>

- (summary of the problem)
- EF: I would be happy for a PR to do a scope aware version of this
- we could also just do the determanistic random version
- DT: this is only a problem in the sourcemap
- we can workaround this by enabling `inline_source_maps: true` https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-template-imports?tab=readme-ov-file#sourcemap-generation
- EF: probably fine for now but we should solve this for other people too
- the randomish string is good for now
- CM: we could also do both, a quick fix for now and we could do the harder rust implementation later
