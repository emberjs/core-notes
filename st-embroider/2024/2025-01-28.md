- CM: I don't know if we should drop lint support like this
- EF: agree
- (discussion about previous architecture decisions of ember-template-lint)
- EF: I think we could come around to dropping hbs-backtick support

- KG: do we have an eslint against using hbs-backticks? 
- (discussion about release order)
- KG: how likly is it to move things to eslint?
- (discussion about the implementation difficulty)
- EF: how many of the rules are actually broken because they aren't aware of scope
- PS: there are overrides that we are disabling for gjs right now: https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/blob/master/lib/config/recommended.js#L100-L126
