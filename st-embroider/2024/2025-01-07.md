## Topics

### Project updates

- EF: hbs resolving is now covered in the resolver which should make the GJS codemod and webpack inversion of control easier


### Future of: ember-fetch, RFC to officially deprecate?, add util to test-waiters? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- (discussion)
- EF: I think this should be an RFC
- should we still release a v2 of it? there is some risk there
- 

### Recommend v2 addons? (banner on docs to look at addon-blueprint?) <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: should we link to the v2 blueprint? 
- EF: what do we even say about addons in the website
- CM: https://cli.emberjs.com/release/writing-addons/
- EF: we could add a callout to suggest that we're working on a new blueprint
- CM: there is a roadmap item to make it the default
- blocker is to add a non-monrepo blueprint
- we're not bocked on this now
- EF: we do need to solve the ember-try question, maybe we could do a scenario-tester style solution
- we might just want to use scenario tester with a simpler facade
- 

### any blockers on releasing main other than https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/issues/2207 <@mansona>

- discussed 
- EF: nothing blocking, go ahead with the plan to do alphas
