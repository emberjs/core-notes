## Topics

### several cascading bugs <@ef4>

- EF: CI on main is broken because of bad merge because of auto-merge
- ember-auto-import CI is failing because of canary
- canary is failing because of fastboot
- fastboot CI was not running
- many yaks to shave 😭
- PR 20974 to ember.js caused the issue - it was intended to 

### review go-no-go criteria for Vite https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/10814 - also added this to the standing agenda until 6.8 is released <@mansona>

- CM: walked through some of the tasks
- some of them are already in progress


### strange typescript interaction when upgrading an app to vite <@mansona>

- Classic blueprint has not upgraded to the new typescript “base” 
- New base doens’t have "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature"
- Old blueprint lies about podmodule prefix being in the config (in the d.ts file for the config)
- We should probably deprecate pods maybe?

### is codemod-cli a problem/liability for us now? <@mansona>

- https://github.com/rwjblue/codemod-cli/pull/266

- Rob contacted, we now have access to github and npm
- CI needs some improvements
- we can get that merged
- 

### glint is generating declarations with .gjs.d.ts extensions and that is causing issues <@mansona>

- E.g. https://github.com/CvX/vite-imports-test/tree/main/apps/vite-app/declarations/components
- This makes it not targetable from the package.json exports
- https://github.com/CvX/vite-imports-test/blob/main/apps/vite-app/package.json#L28-L34



<5 mins> Bare route templates and the router.js don’t allow you to emit declarations when in JS only mode <@mansona>
I think this is important for a road to glint installed and configured by default for JS apps
Some problems around mixins, could be solved automatically with their removal
https://github.com/CvX/vite-imports-test/blob/main/apps/vite-app/app/router.js#L5
<5 mins> Do we have a plan for getting the alpha glint VSCode addon to be released? <@mansona>
<10 mins> Package Security <@kmg>
OIDC support in release plan
ember-source now has OIDC
Culling contributors / Archiving Repos / Collapsing Orgs
