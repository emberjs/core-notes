## Topics

### Quick update on the Route Manager API work - direction and current analysis focus <@nickshot or @mansona> 

- (update on the current analysis)
- KG: I thought we were not intending to implement the current router with a manager 
- CM: not really, we intend to allow zebra striping by wrapping the old thing with a full manager api
- (discussion about capabilities)
- next steps - capture the transition object in the same level of detail

### Config access <@kategengler> 

- Prompted by https://github.com/cibernox/ember-basic-dropdown/pull/1020
- KG: addons are all coming up with their own boilerplate for config environment
- we should discuss how this should be done and where to document this
- PS: once we get past compat there is a good thing in babel macros
- EF: that's not the same thing - there is often confusion about this
- the referenced PR is all about runtime config
- we have never designed the new thing - we could have a nice key-value thing that is namespaced by addon
- having a module that addons read isn't how modules work
- we could teach people how to do this the Vite way (environment variables)
- we need to solve 2 things
  - how do app developers swap behaviours based on build
  - and how do addons consume app config
- KG: it's nice that config/environment.js is "one place" and we don't need to track down all the random places
- EF: agreed
- another thing to consider is that if every addon imports something that sets a config it side-steps splitting logic
- CM: (mentioned that you can use owner.lookup to get things)
- PS: no you need to do `owner.resolveRegistration('config:environment')` because it's not the same
- EF: that could be contributing to the confusion
- KG: maybe this is just a communication thing then
- CM: but I think it could be simpler to understand and teach
- EF: it could just be a service that does something similar
- we could allow the app to define a config in the old or new way, but the addons would use a single api
- (discussion of the current state of things again)
- EF: katie is right, the key thing here is a communication problem
- there could be some benefit to import a function from your addon to solve type problems
- it could just be a type and not a real implementation
- CM: to wrap up - if someone came to us now asking how to migrate to a v2 addon should we point them to the owner.resoveregistration idea?
- EF: yes that sounds good, it's not an API we can break any time soon anyway
