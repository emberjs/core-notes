## Roadmap review

- EF: working on Ember 5.10 issues with test waiters

- A: has been working on gjs codemod. Currently living in `@embroider/compat`
  
  PR: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1842
  
  docs: https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/tree/stable?tab=readme-ov-file#template-tag-codemod
  
  Discussed how resolution works. Currently it depends on the Embroider resolver, which means apps need to be compatible with Embroider's static flags. That means it can't be used as a tool by complex apps to migrate apps towards the static flags.

  EF suggested that perhaps codemods should spit out a list of 'questions', they could be answered by pasting something into the console in a running app, which would return JSON. Codemod would then finish the transformation. Kinda like the existing runtime codemods, but without the fragile puppetteer integration.

- Progress is being made on Embroider/Vite plugin. Next big step is https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1936

- Done with adding deprecations to Ember 5.x. Runtime module resolution deprecation didn't land, but that's ok
