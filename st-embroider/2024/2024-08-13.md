<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### Project update

- Vite plugin is almost done. One more PR and then we can try building without the rewritten app.
- Work still working on the GJS codemod. The next version will try upgrading a typescript project.

### No AppTree Merging <@NullVoxPopuli>

- outstanding issue overriding things in your app with javascript and typescript not working well together
- if you override with TS the base JS still wins
- CM: is this fixed in the new Vite situation?
- PS: not sure
- the option that I'm proposing here is that we stop automatic app tree merging and instead splat the addon app tress into the end user's app folder
- CM: i discussed this with EF a while back when we were struggling to justify the work of creating a app tree syncing implementation
- Ed's recent PR to fix extension search is likely a better fix for this
- CM & PS will work on testing this in https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/package-majors
