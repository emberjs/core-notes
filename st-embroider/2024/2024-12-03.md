## Topics

### do we want to require any changes to the v2 app RFC? <@NullVoxPopuli>

- CM: I want to get the rfc accepted
- can we solve the issue with exact spelling of ember-cli-build until after accepted?
- EF: yes as long as we go and update the RFC after it's decided
- also the api will be a blocker to getting an alpha/beta released
- we should comment on the fact that ast plugins go in the babel config
- we could also make the babel config a bit cleaner

### initial feedback on RFC concept https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/1054 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- this RFC is so that we can have a different release cadence for 
- KG: we discussed the idea of getting the latest version of something
- initial reaction is that this shouldn't be an RFC
- always getting the latest blueprint would be awesome
- EF: is this also a proposal to make interactive the default? 
- (discussion about it being a different RFC)
- when the app blueprint becomes default then we shouldn't need to copy it into ember-cli
- making external blueprints a good thing even for the defaults is a good motivation

### new ember-try defaults https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/issues/993 <@NullVoxPopuli>

 - (discussion of the issue)
 - KG: this would need to be a major
 - (general discussion - not really disagreeing with this)
 - CM: we need to allow people to opt-into running scripts

### test-waiters v2 addon https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-waiters/pull/476 https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2191<@NullVoxPopuli>

- we shouldn't need ember-auto-import change
- if this doesn't work we should fix it
- there could be a bug
- (commented on the situation)

### direction? Ember-fetch: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-fetch/pull/754 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- previously discussed it - don't remember our conclusions
- EF: we could just use waitForPromise
- PS: we should just update the guides to tell people to waitForPromise
- KG: we should probably go ahead with this to give people an upgrade path
- EF: maybe we just extend global fetch to make it waited? 
- this is a good PR though because it means we remove one last classic addon
- why are we holding a copy of originalFetch?
- moving the lookup into the function would be safer
- why is it not a library
