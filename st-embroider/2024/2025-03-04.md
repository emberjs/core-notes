## Topics

### move the template-tag codemod from yargs to commander? https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2320 <@mansona>

- EF: yea probably ok. Now is the time to do this if arguments will change
- CM: I'll finish the PR then

### route  generator strict flag name https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/20835 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: probably another bikeshed discussion: what should the arg name be
- CM: does this have a backing class tag
- (discussion about the benefits of this)
- A: shouldn't we just name things based on the edition
- (much agreement, some ooos)
- (discussion about if we need to have the ability to opt into polaris more granularly)
- CM: we might not because the blueprints get shipped with ember-source so it doesn't need to be aware what is possible in this ember version


### moar minimal <@NullVoxpopuli>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2301
- PS: embroider/compat not a dep any more
- (looking through the PR)
- CM: this is mergable now right? we can improve it later
- EF: merged

### type=module in compat mode just works <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: we should move the blueprint to this
- EF: that's fine - we should check macros still work
- PS: they do
- EF: the final boss of type=modules is v2 addons.
- this should unblock Vite SSR
