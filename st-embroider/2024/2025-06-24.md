## Topics

### sync on the self-imports in v2 addons situation <@NullVoxPopuli>

- PS: self imports on their own don't work by themselves
- subpath imports can only be used for the test app
  - investigation: rollup doesn't inline it
  - we need to fix it
- EF: what happens in the build today? does rollup remove it
- PS: we want the vite test app to read the source files, and it can't go through the exports in the package.json because that targets tests
- we achieve that by using alias
- CM: shouldn't we have CI run against a rollup dist
- EF: there are a lot of differences between

### V2 addon monorepo setup with classic like behaviour that is not ‘published’ <@void-mAlex>

- (long description of the problem)
- it's nice for us to be able to consume non-built addons for monorepos
- an example would be the things that you need to do to get test-selectors working right between addon builds 
- EF: it's a good thing to add to the blueprint as a "mode" 
  - maybe something like `--internal-addon` or `--no-build`
  - we can yak shave later

### https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2477 <@NullVoxPopuli, Simon>

- merged
- CM: I'm still not sure why the changelog isn't picking up the change
- EF: that's probably because of how I merged stable forward and the number of conficts
- CM: I'll merge the release and we can update the changelog later


### https://github.com/embroider-build/ember-auto-import/pull/659 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- closed
- the real fix is in `@ember/compat` and it needs to account for addon-shim and ember-auto-import versions

### Ignoring bad syntax in a tag name <@patricklx>

- look at https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/2e263500cf1707871d072adbb3d5b00b/fa99860456ff82a762ec20d4233a5f4656e04759
- Notice that it doesn't throw any error….
- And the fix is https://github.com/tildeio/simple-html-tokenizer/pull/114 
- (digging into the PR)
- EF: looks mostly ok
- merged

### Fix NODE_ENV for tests <@NullVoxPopuli>

- https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-app-blueprint/pull/33
- EF: we discussed this at length. Regarding the security question: we accept the reality that having a `.env.[mode]` file is the way that Vite wants us to do it
- we want to make sure that the comment explains the issue and links to the vite docs
- approved
- merged

### fixing `@ember/debug` and `babel-plugin-debug-macros` <@robbytx>

- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2501
- https://github.com/ember-cli/babel-plugin-debug-macros/pull/103  

- CM: can't we use the `NODE_ENV` fix that we just merged to solve this?
- EF: maybe? 
- (looking at the PR)
- it would be good to start killing this plugin
- this is an older ember issue, ember-source after 5.12 uses `@embroider/macros`

<5 mins> https://github.com/emberjs/babel-plugin-ember-template-compilation/pull/98 fix moduleName leaking build system file system paths <@void-mAlex>
