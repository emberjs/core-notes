## Topics

### Roadmap review

- ember-sorce as v2 addon
  - good progress
  - working in classic
  - needs a bit of work in embroider to fix hard-coded locations
- ship everything in the blueprint as a v2 addon
  - new pr to ember-fetch to make it a v2 addon
- webpack inversion of control
  - PS: can't do this right now if someone else wants to chat about it
- RFC for v2 app
  - CM: making some progress on it

### Seek help/hints for debugging, open for pairing @gossi

- https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/1301909345985892363

- G: (description of the issue)
  - quick summary: similar to the layering issue
  - potentially in an addon that loads an addon that loads an addon
  - also ember-command v2 is now a v2 addon
- EF: first thing to check is that there are two copies in your the module tree

### fix gjs/gts sourcemaps from @embroider/addon-dev https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2162 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: we could get content tag to return a separate source map
- it's very easy to get SWC to return what we need
- PS: that would need to be a major of content tag
- EF: sure
- it would be worth trying to see if we can do this down in content-tag, otherwise we can just go ahead with this PR
- PS: rojer rojer


### Hygiene alternative for content-tag https://github.com/embroider-build/content-tag/pull/83 <@NullVoxPopuli / @wagenet> 

- PW: we could make this cleaner before merging
- CM: this seems ready... but you said you need to do more work?
- EF: currently you get a new import of template per template in the file
- maybe we can only have one template import per file
- we could just merge it now and make it better later
- merging as a bugfix

### label party on decorator-transforms https://github.com/ef4/decorator-transforms/pull/41 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- all done!
