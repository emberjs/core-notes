## Topics

  - 

### Review https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2466 <ef4>

- (deep dive into the proposed fix)
- found a better solution 
- commented on the PR

### Macros unintentional breaking change <ef4>

- (discussed to figure out how fix this)
- https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2439 is a good CI failing
- EF: I've added a todo to fix this

### Review https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/2464 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- approved
- github having issues, waiting for CI to pass

### template-tag-codemod canâ€™t find helpers from @ember/string <@mansona>

- ember string never provided any helpers
- this is likely an issue with some other addon exporting the helper
- to debug: step into the capitalize helper using `{{debugger}}` in the hbs and see where the file is actually coming from
- (discussion about custom resolver not allowing you to have named imports)
- agreement: we can optionally return an object with the named import that we want to support
