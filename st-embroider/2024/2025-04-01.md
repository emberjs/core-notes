## Topics



### Should @ember/test-helpers, @ember/test-waiters, be put in ember-source? <@NullVoxPopuli> 

- Test-helpers, specifically, relies on private APIs
- EF: what are we being using
- PS: we are using things like setOnError
- EF: is the need for this because we don't have setComponent
- I would prefer to stabilise the apisthat are being used
- (discussion of what the actual things are)
- EF: a lot of the examples are things that are on the way out
- we could just wait and remove them when they're not being used any more


### what should happen with https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/1528 <@NullVoxPopuli>

- EF: looks good
- we need to fix the conflict to continue
- 

### A new attempt at my strategy of splitting ember-cli and the blueprint system: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/10671 <@mansona>

- (long discussion about the strategy)
- EF: we can do this but don't change behaviour i.e. don't resolve from cwd
- most of what ember-try's complexity is around local running and trying to support monorepos, which have seemingly unlimited configuration issues

### Non-monorepo V2 addon with ember test matrix example <@ef4> 

- example: 
  - https://github.com/ef4/memory-scroll/ 
  - https://github.com/embroider-build/try

- EF: looking for feedback for people who are using ember-try
- KG: bert has been working on upgrading ember-try it would be great if we could chat to him about rolling this in
- (discussion about ember-try running your package manager for you)
-
